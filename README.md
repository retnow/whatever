# What is Whatever?
Whatever is a closet organisation app, born half out of inspiration and half out of the need to organise my own clothing collection.

The 'inspiration' part of the story comes from one of my favourite movies of all time, Clueless (1995) - which, yes, also influenced the project's name. I so wished I had Cher's personal styling machine as a kid - and then built a really low fidelity prototype before a talk I gave this year.

After gathering other people's ideas about what people want out of a closet organisation app, as well as collating my own, this is where I'm at.

# Who's building this?
So far it's a one-woman show, friends. Contact me if you want to help out!
